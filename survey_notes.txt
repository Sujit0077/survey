Blockchain is digital, decentralized technology which maintains a record of all the transactions 
which happen over a peer-to-peer network. These records are stored in decentralized systems 
which are interconnected. Blockchains are “tamper evident and tamper resistant digital ledgers 
implemented in a distributed fashion (i.e., without a central repository) and usually without a 
central authority (i.e., a bank, company or government)”. 
 
Blockchain innovation empowers the “production of a decentralized domain, where the 
cryptographically approved exchanges and information are not under the control of any outsider 
association”. Any exchange at any point finished is recorded in an unchanging record in a 
certain, safe, straightforward and perpetual way, with a timestamp and different subtleties. 
 
Blockchain allows industries to store records of any type on the blockchain. Some of them are: 
 
 Identity management 
 Business transactions 
 Medical transaction records 
 Transaction processing 
 General documentation 
 Management activities 
 Public and Private Blockchains 
 Securing applications 
 Auditing 
 Database security 
 Digital workforce training 
 Continuity planning 
 Proper testing methods 
 Key Principles of Blockchain Which Ensure Safety 
In a public blockchain, anyone can participate in the network. It is a permissionless blockchain 
where even anonymous people can enter. These use the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake 
consensus algorithms. Public blockchains have a low transaction speed. 
 
Examples: Bitcoin and Ethereum 
Private blockchains ensure privacy and security of data. Here, participation requires an invitation 
which is validated by a set of rules. There is an added layer of privacy on public blockchains as 
participant activity for certain transactions is restricted. It uses the voting or multi-party 
consensus mechanism. It is a lighter blockchain and hence the transaction speed is high. 
 
Examples: Hyperledger

Each blockchain block consists of: 
 
 certain data 
 the hash of the block 
 the hash from the previous block


use cases:
